# zap-vscode

A simple extension that provides intellisense and highlighting for the [Zap](https://github.com/red-blox/zap/tree/main) IDL.
Large portion of the code comes from [this](https://github.com/red-blox/zap/blob/main/docs/.vitepress/components/Editor.vue) file.
This extension attempts to mimic the highlighting and intellisense seen inside of the Zap playground, so users do not need to use a web page in order to efficiently write Zap code, and can instead stay inside their editor.

Support for other editors is not planned.
